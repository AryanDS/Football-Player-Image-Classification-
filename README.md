# Football-Player-Image-Classification-

In this Data Science Project we classify my favorite football players using their images.

1.Cristiano Ronaldo
2.Lionel Messi
3.Karim benzema
4.Mbappe
5.Neymar
6.Robert lewandowski

Approach
1. Data Gathering: Used Fatkun to download images.

2. Data Cleaning: For detecting the face and the eyes we would be using OpenCV (Image Processing Library in Python)
For Specific detection we would be using HarreCascade to detect the same. 

3. Feature Engineering: In order to extract facial features from the images, we used Wavelet transform and then stacked the wavelet transformed image and cropped images

4. Used GridSearchCV to get the best parameters for our model.
5.
